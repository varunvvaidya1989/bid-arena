# bid-arena
BidArena is a real-time, config-driven player auction system built with React, Node.js, and AWS. It supports virtual point-based bidding, role-based access (Admin/Captain), live WebSocket updates, dynamic max-bid validation, and extensible player stats—designed as a production-grade personal project.
